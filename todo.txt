ToDo: 
- Account for all special cases
	- hard-copy vs soft-copy price -> before and after purchases
	- classes and their recurring weirdness
	- MPA on users not firm
	- MP (live + hard-copy or digital) (Note about CPE credit can be applied)
	- MP-past (hard-copy or digital) (Note about CPE credit cannot be applied)
	- ...
- allow registration of email w/o login information (process)?
- Explain setting up an account (your information, not person signing up for conference)
- Group access codes
- Hard-copy price
- non-angular feedback form
- Notify users of un-supported browsers
- output strings objects (both php and js)
- password reset functionality
- phone validator (register/xx > add attendee > add employee)
- photo upload field (doesn't store, just emails)
- possible to add more attendees, not remove attendees
- Purchases page (calling in attendee changes)
- replace all alert statements with DOM level alerts
- show if event is un-open or not available at current time (manual)
- store referrer for redirects back to site

- CUSTOM PAYMENT DELETE NOT WORKING!

Emails (to-do):
- New firm registration
- Adding people to firm
- New registration

In a holding pattern:
- build administration section (see if user end is accepted)
	- Discounts
	- Downloads
	- Firms (merge)
	- Groups
	- Items
	- Memberships
	- Products
	- Purchases
	- ...

Notes:
- Add conference type product -> Force insert into tie_product_field
- Add price to new products
- Admin can drop attendees

Questions:
- how old of a browser do we need to support (provide un-supported browser warnings)

Future releases
- assign status to orders (processing, confirmed, etc)
- care about custom payments (find a way to store them)
- download proxy? to ensure files have been purchased? (php script)
- find a better deployment than 'ftp-deploy'
- handle invoices
- have `item` settings store raw data instead of json encoded data
- periodically make calls back to server to check for additions to php cart
- register user / select address for a list of firm addresses
- sync with Luke's UAN member site
- use key based paypal checkout
