ToDo: 
- Implement Form constraints for checkout
- Check checkout
- Previous purchases (for downloads, need to do conference and groups)
- Prevent repeat purchases (links removed from site, removed from cart on 'get' for offsite, warning for stragglers #overkill)
- Cart: instead of settinng, attendee to assigned, set it to a string of names, something readable (for use in list-purchase)


Notes:
- Add conference type product -> Force insert into tie_product_field
