Questions:
- Can we get a test domain up and running (store.upstreamacademy.com)
- how old of a browser do we need to support
	- iff not old -> try this for array unique (php cart merge within index.php) http://stackoverflow.com/a/11247231
- add a new paypal service to "us" account, just use mine, wait until we go to production and convert past paypal service

Future releases
- download proxy? to ensure files have been purchased? (php script)
