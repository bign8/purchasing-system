ToDo: 
- Account for all special cases
	- hardcopy vs softcopy price -> before and after purchases
	- classes and their recurring wierdness
	- ...
- allow registration of email w/o login information (process)?
- Checkout / Continue Shopping / Close
- Give old and discount price based on groups (show and give reason)
- Implement Form constraints for checkout
- improve form constraints for register/xx
- migrate logic to a rest type structure
- Modify links on both carts to use db links if available, otherwise txt
- password reset functionoality
- password show as red for invalid passwd
- photo upload field (doesn't store, just emails)
- possible to add more attendees, not remove attendees
- pretty crumb use localStorage
- replace all alert statements with dom level alerts
- show if event is un-open or not available at current time (manual)
- store referrer for redirects back to site

Emails (todo):
- Cart checkout details (cost, payment type, misc fields)
- Register firm modifications

In a holding pattern:
- build administration section (see if user end is accepted)
	- Discounts
	- Downloads
	- Firms (merge)
	- Groups
	- Items
	- Memberships
	- Products
	- Purchases
	- ...

Notes:
- Add conference type product -> Force insert into tie_product_field
- Add price to new fields

Questions:
- how old of a browser do we need to support
	- iff not old -> try this for array unique (php cart merge within index.php) http://stackoverflow.com/a/11247231
- remove duplicates on server or notify user of duplicates? (enforce no re purchases, but notify users)

Future releases
- assign status to orders (processing, confirmed, etc)
- download proxy? to ensure files have been purchased? (php script)
- handle invoices
- periodically make calls back to server to check for additions to php cart
- Previous purchases -> modify attendees to a conference, priced accordingly
- register user / select address for a list of firm addresses
- use key based paypal checkout
