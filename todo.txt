ToDo: 
- Implement Form constraints for checkout
- Previous purchases (for downloads + conference, need to do groups)
- periodically make calls back to server to check for additions to php cart
- pull pending group pricing when a group membership is in the cart
- pull pricing based on group membership

Notes:
- Add conference type product -> Force insert into tie_product_field


Questions:
- Can we get a test domain up and running (store.upstreamacademy.com)
- how old of a browser do we need to support
	- iff not old -> try this for array unique (php cart merge within index.php) http://stackoverflow.com/a/11247231
